## DailyTable.R

This [script](https://github.com/MariiaChernysh/Useful-R-scripts/blob/master/DailyTable.R) provides .csv output containing a non-formatted pivot table with several groupings.
The output will present a summary on Managers' KPIs divided by traffic sources they use. The tricky part is that different Managers can work with the same Traffic Sources and their stats should be calculated considering this issue. Data sample can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qc4ehDXPkuVnmfeAPpuALehgqDn1_pBC/view?usp=sharing).
